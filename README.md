# Bklr - a Bakaláři client library written in Rust
I am a high school student from the Czech Republic and I really don't like our school system.  
It is slow, and I mean very slow; The only way to access the school system that really works is the official one. There are quite a few problems with the mobile and web apps which I will not describe in depth; Most of them are beyond the scope of this library and README anyway.


## Development milestones
Bklr has quite a long way to go to being complete in terms of features - but that doesn't mean you can't help! At least, in the future. Right now, I'm still arranging my thoughts and ideas, but help will be appreciated. Here is a list of things I anticipate on doing:

* Asynchronous Bakaláři client
* Synchronous (blocking) Bakaláři client
* Granular control over parts of the library (custom tokens instead of hard-coded flow, etc..)
* An app built on top of this library by me!

These will gradually get crossed off the README as I meet these milestones! Maybe I'll move these into a GitHub project, who knows.  

## Credits
#### Massive thanks to these projects and people:
* [Better Schedule by Vít Skalický](https://gitlab.com/vitSkalicky/lepsi-rozvrh/) - reference and some ideas
* [Bakaláři API v3 reverse engineered documentation](https://github.com/bakalari-api/bakalari-api-v3) - I think this is obvious why
* [The _freecodecamp_ team](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) and particularly [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpPEoZW5IiY) - a full, free Rust course, this has helped me a lot, also obvious
